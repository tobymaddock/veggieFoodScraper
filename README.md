# veggieFoodScraper

Cool project to allow me to compare the protein content of various recipes found online. I'm going to rename this 'parse-ly' or 'parse-nip'. Uses asynchio to handle requests.

For now, scrapes:
- BBC good food

In progress:
- Epicurious
- BBC foods

Features to be added:
Some analysis of the 'completeness' of the protein source.
