# veggieFoodScraper

Cool project to allow me to compare the protein content of various recipes found online. I'm going to rename this 'parse-ly' or 'parse-nip'. Uses asynchio to handle requests.

For now, scrapes:
- BBC good food

In progress:
- Epicurious
- BBC foods

# Features to be added:
 - Some analysis of the 'completeness' of the protein source.
 - Use some nutrition database to associate foods with their nutritional content - which will mean sites with unlisted nutritional data can still be scraped.
 - Natural language processing so phrases like 'a handful of parsley' can be associated with a weight.
